Access the appropriate wireless settings pane on the device to be connected and select the Eduroam network.

These advisories are automatically copied to the instructor, student's advisors, and the Office of Academic Affairs. The Academic Affairs Committee keeps track of all advisories and the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs will meet with students who receive two or more advisories. Advisories can be used for concerns such as missing assignments or poor performance, but they can also be used to send positive notes about improvements or good exam performance. The advisory system can also be used to schedule conferences with students. Available to faculty and emeritus at HMC. The Academic Advisory System can be accessed by logging into the HMC Portal and looking in the Faculty tab.\\nSelecting a course takes you to a class list from which you can select one or more students. The next step allows you to enter any additional personalized comments and/or request a conference with the student(s).

However, CIS will no longer support the third-party service Formstack after August 2023. They are offering help in training and transferring forms from Formstack to Kuali. In general, they recommend using Google Forms for simple surveys on campus, while Kuali is better for forms that display information from HMC data sources or require extensive form logic. For formal academic research, they suggest purchasing an account with Qualtrics or another survey tool provider. Additionally, users need to be mindful of FERPA compliance when storing and sharing data from online forms. Available to faculty, students, staff, alumni, and emeritus at HMC. To use Google Forms, login to HMC Google Workplace website, then\\u00a0navigate to Forms using the Apps menu in the top-right corner.
